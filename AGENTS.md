# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `include/dlite/`: Public headers (`*.hpp`) for the DLite library.
- `src/`: Library implementation (`*.cpp`), currently focused on file loading.
- `test/`: Test executables (simple C++ mains); targets are wired in `test/CMakeLists.txt`.
- `docs/README.md`: Quick build notes and project status.
- `examples/`: Reserved for sample programs (currently empty).
- `build/`: Out-of-source build directory (generated by CMake).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja`: Configure the project with Ninja (adjust generator as needed).
- `cmake --build build`: Build the `DLite` static library and test executables.
- `./build/test/load_test` (or `./build/test/load_test.exe` on Windows): Run the current loader test.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- C++20 is required (`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`).
- Use 4-space indentation and K&R brace style to match existing code.
- Naming: `lower_snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/structs.
- Headers live under `include/dlite/` and use `#pragma once`; keep public APIs in the `dlite` namespace.

## Testing Guidelines
- No unit test framework is wired yet; tests are standalone executables.
- Add new tests as `*.cpp` files in `test/` and register them in `test/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Favor small, focused tests that exercise a single feature (e.g., loader, parser).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages are short, imperative, and concrete (examples: "Create CMakeLists.txt", "Update README.md").
- PRs should describe the change, list how to build/run tests, and note the platform verified.

## Platform Notes
- `read_file` is Windows-only and uses the Win32 file dialog; non-Windows builds will throw at runtime.
- On Windows, the library links `comdlg32`; ensure your toolchain provides it.
